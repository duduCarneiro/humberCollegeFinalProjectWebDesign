This project is a website coded in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to Course Project CPAN134 - Web Programming and Design by Eduardo Carneiro n01536084.

The content is the Final Project Submission.

The navigation starts at the homepage, named Homepage. 
It can be accessed from any page by clicking on the house image at the very left on the nav bar.

The site has a Bio page with a brief description of me.
It also has a Resume page with my curriculum and a Showcase page with my last projects.
Finally, there is a contact page with a form to leave a message.

The nav bar uses a JavaScript effect of changing the size of the links when the mouse goes over it calling the functions getBigger and getNormal.

The Showcase page also uses JavaScript to turn off the blur effect on the images once you pass the mouse over the cards
Additionally, it shows a short explanation of the project when you point it with the mouse. 
Both effects are trigged with embedded JS code "onmouseover" "onmouseout" calling functions that change the opacity and the filter of the elements.

The form on the Contact page allows you to leave a message that, after being submitted, it is displayed at first on the top of the current messages.
It has a non-persistent data base since JavaScript only works on the client side.
But it is just an illustration of what is possible with JavaScript.

If someone wants to leave a message without identification, they just have to click on the correspondent checkbox.

The form also uses Datalist Form control to identify the user's occupation



The footer has links to all my social media.
